                    <p>First envisioned by A Song of Ice and Fire author George R.R. Martin before its depiction in the HBO series, Westeros is a harsh realm where winters can last a lifetime. Maybe a bit of an understatement, considering how short a lifespan tends to be in Westeros, for high nobles and smallfolk alike. Winter, on the other hand, can last forever, or close to it. It’s why the show’s most recognizable phrase and House Stark’s sacred words, “Winter is coming,” carry such grave connotations: Meteorology in Westeros is an inexact science at best, and once the snow starts to fall, it might be years, decades even, before it stops.

                        It's unclear why seasons are so drastic and last so long in Westeros, but deadly winters have long been par for the course. Thousands of years before the start of the series, Westeros was home to the Children of the Forest, an ancient people gifted with great power and reverence for the land. Eventually, humans conquered the continent, forcing the Children to flee to the far north. Their struggle paved the way for a deadly new species: the White Walkers, cold-blooded creatures with ice in their veins and annihilation in their hearts. The Children and mankind were forced to cast aside their differences and join forces to defeat their common enemy, which ultimately resulted in the construction of the magical Wall that separates Westeros into two distinct halves: an uncharted tundra populated by fierce and frostbitten individuals called Wildlings; and everything that stands below.</p>
